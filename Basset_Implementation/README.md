# IFT6135 Assignment 1 Programming

Check the PDF for the most up to date instructions regarding this assignment.

Below are the instructions for running the notebook on Google Colab:

1) First, copy the dataset `er.zip` from this [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D98T87RimVys61q9YHm55-gL7tZmpZS4?usp=sharing) to your drive with right click -> "make a copy".
2) Next, clone this github repo and upload the contents of `assignment1` to your drive. **Make sure that all the contents of the repo and  `er.zip` are in the same directory**!
3) You can then open `main-EN.ipynb` (English version) or `main-FR.ipynb` (French version) using Google Colab. You may need to install Colab first. If you are not familiar with Colab, please consult [the tutorials](https://colab.research.google.com/) for more information.
4) You will be prompted to allow access to your drive folder.
5) In the section entitled "Link your assignment folder & install requirements", please write the full path to the directory you will be working in. If you are in your root, this would be: `/content/gdrive/MyDrive/`.
6) Please follow the instructions in the notebook very carefully. The docstring in `solution.py` should also be helpful.
